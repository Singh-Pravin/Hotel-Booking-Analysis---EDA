EDA Hotel Booking Analysis

## Summary

Travelling is common these days and that too not only in locals but around the world. Planning a stay in other cities or countries is so easy nowadays when you are travelling. In this EDA project, we were provided with a series of data that we have to use to analyze multiple important factors that govern the bookings.

As the first step, we have used multiple libraries so that we can plot different charts, graphs and maps to get the information while analyzing the complete set of data.

In the second step, we have created a copy of original data set and then displayed the unique values from it. Later on, we have cleared the duplicate data which makes easier to analyze the dataset.

Initially, we have analyzed the bookings and cancellations of particular hotel to know that which hotel is more preferred by the customers. Then, we have analyzed the more number of cancellations are done in which deposit types.

Further analysis is done on the bookings done by different types of channels, according to the market segments. Analysis on how many special requests done for a room, most cancellations done by which country, whether the reserved room and the assigned room is same or not.

In this entire analysis of hotel bookings, we estimated the best daily rate, optimal length of stay and the did the comparison between them by plotting a bar graph. At the end we have analyzed which channel gives the best average daily rate, repeated customers and have displayed them using scatter plot.

At the end after doing multiple observations on the important factors of booking, it has been observed that cancellations are most in the case of city hotel where there is no deposit done. July and august are the most preferred months. It is concluded that the best daily rate is given by resort hotel when the optimal length of stay increases. Most of the special requests are observed in the case of booking that has been done by TA/TO.
